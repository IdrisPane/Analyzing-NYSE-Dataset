# Analyzing-NYSE-Dataset

## Introduction
In this project, I have analyzed real-life data from the New York Stock Exchange provided by Kaggle that contains historical financial data from S&P 500 companies and already created a smaller subset of the data on this project.

## Why this Project?
This project will introduced me to the data analysis process that i will be using throughout the rest of the Business Analytics Nanodegree program. In this project, i learnt and made the summary statistics, drawing an inference from the statistics, calculating business metrics and using models to forecast future growth prospects for the companies. The goal from this project is for me to perform an analysis and also create visual tools to communicate the results in informative ways.
